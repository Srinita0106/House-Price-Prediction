# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning, specifically a linear regression model. It involves exploratory data analysis, feature examination, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The objective is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices using key housing and neighborhood attributes. The process includes:

- Loading and analyzing the housing dataset
- Exploring relationships between features and the target (house price)
- Building a linear regression model
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Features Used

The dataset contains critical variables including:

- CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation


Let me know if you want me to create a combined README for both projects or generate a requirements.txt file.
